I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away
I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away
I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away
I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away

Body dumped on me road
When I was six
Stabbed to death and left on the bricks
No training that week
My coach couldn't speak
Blood on his hands as the man died at his feet
And me, I stood at the scene
No sheets to block the bodies we dream
They stay evergreen
Senior infants show and tell
What did ya do the weekend, are ya well?
Stand in front of the class as they ask
Ya tell them you looked at the blood left on the road
From the man who slept in the field outside your window
Got thrown out of a car with a knife through his heart
In the morning stars, Terrified
I went quiet and I stood
And I started to run from love
'Cause you're told
You need to grow cold to grow old
I was 7, in that same field beside me gaff
Kicking through the leaves and the grass
Until two garda rock up batons in hand
And leave ya crying for your Mam
And this is no dramatics
This is no tales of 90's classics
You spend your whole life being brave
And you hope things will change
So don't fucking ask me why I don't want to age
It just marks the time of things staying the same
But the songs sound fun, and you dance with your mates
And it's grand then
Until the next day

I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away
I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away
I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away
I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away

Then you're 9, 10, and 11
In the same place the garda got ya at 7
Takin' the sides off trains with stones
We did that 'cause we were broke
We did that 'cause we had no hope
Or place to go, or well
We did that 'cause we didn't say no 20 years ago
And it still comes out still when we get vocal
Singing in the local
A lonely feeling came over me stealing
Some sober as a judge
The other boys out the nut
And all of us dancing like there's no one left in the world but us
And these days it feels like there isn't
There's no way to put that loss into words
But we'll wrap arms around shoulders and scream love from our lungs
We'll escape to Friday football and hugs
And tell tales of nights and days spent in teenage fun
'Cause the world is a cruel, cruel place without the love
So we'll spend the rest of our life being brave
And hope that things will change
And age will still mark the time in the same way
But I'll hold on a little tighter
To the love of my mates
Forever and a day

I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away
I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away
I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away
I keep giving up on her
Keeps on running away

I know, I know whispering words of freedom
I know, I know whispering words of freedom
I know, I know whispering words of freedom
I know, I know whispering words of freedom
I know, I know whispering words of freedom
I know, I know whispering words of freedom
I know, I know whispering words of freedom
I know, I know whispering words of freedom

It's been a while since I've seen your face
It's been a while since I've seen your face
I can't face the day
It's been a while since I've seen your face
It's been a while since I've seen your face
I can't face the day
